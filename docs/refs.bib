	abstract = {I describe a Bayesian method to account for measurement errors in linear regression of astronomical data. The method allows for heteroscedastic and possibly correlated measurement errors, and intrinsic scatter in the regression relationship. The method is based on deriving a likelihood function for the measured data, and I focus on the case when the intrinsic distribution of the independent variables can be approximated using a mixture of Gaussians. I generalize the method to incorporate multiple independent variables, non-detections, and selection effects (e.g., Malmquist bias). A Gibbs sampler is described for simulating random draws from the probability distribution of the parameters, given the observed data. I use simulation to compare the method with other common estimators. The simulations illustrate that the Gaussian mixture model outperforms other common estimators and can effectively give constraints on the regression parameters, even when the measurement errors dominate the observed scatter, source detection fraction is low, or the intrinsic distribution of the independent variables is not a mixture of Gaussians. I conclude by using this method to fit the X-ray spectral slope as a function of Eddington ratio using a sample of 39 z {\textless} 0.8 radio-quiet quasars. I confirm the correlation seen by other authors between the radio-quiet quasar X-ray spectral slope and the Eddington ratio, where the X-ray spectral slope softens as the Eddington ratio increases.},

	abstract = {This work develops application techniques for stochastic modeling of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs) variability as a probe of accretion disk physics. Stochastic models, specifically Continuous Auto-Regressive Moving Average (CARMA) models, characterize light curves with a perturbation spectrum and an Impulse-Response function, which crucially provides an interpretation for variability timescales. CARMA timescales are not physical but rather, they describe correlation structure and ordered information in stochastic processes. We begin this tutorial by reviewing discrete auto-regressive and moving-average processes, we bridge these components to their continuous analogs, and lastly we investigate the significance of CARMA timescales, obtained by modeling a light curve in the time domain, in relation to the shape of the power spectrum (PSD) and structure function. We determine that higher order CARMA models, for example the Damped Harmonic Oscillator (DHO or CARMA(2, 1)) are more sensitive to deviations from a single-slope power-law description of AGN variability; unlike Damped Random Walks (DRW or CAR(1)) where the PSD slope is fixed, the DHO slope is not. Higher complexity stochastic models than the DRW capture additional covariance in data and output additional characteristic timescales that probe the driving mechanisms of variability. We provide code using Kali software to generate simulations of diverse complexity stochastic light curves. We also provide a heuristic discussion of aliasing effects in ground-based cadences and the importance of light curve length in regards to uncertainty and limitations in timescale estimation.},

	abstract = {We present the use of continuous-time autoregressive moving average (CARMA) models as a method for estimating the variability features of a light curve, and in particular its power spectral density (PSD). CARMA models fully account for irregular sampling and measurement errors, making them valuable for quantifying variability, forecasting and interpolating light curves, and variability-based classification. We show that the PSD of a CARMA model can be expressed as a sum of Lorentzian functions, which makes them extremely flexible and able to model a broad range of PSDs. We present the likelihood function for light curves sampled from CARMA processes, placing them on a statistically rigorous foundation, and we present a Bayesian method to infer the probability distribution of the PSD given the measured light curve. Because calculation of the likelihood function scales linearly with the number of data points, CARMA modeling scales to current and future massive time-domain data sets. We conclude by applying our CARMA modeling approach to light curves for an X-ray binary, two active galactic nuclei, a long-period variable star, and an RR Lyrae star in order to illustrate their use, applicability, and interpretation.},

	abstract = {Continuous-time autoregressive (CAR) processes have been of interest to physicists and engineers for many years (see e.g., Fowler, 1936). Early papers dealing with the properties and statistical analysis of such processes, and of the more general continuous-time autoregressive moving average (CARMA) processes, include those of Doob (1944), Bartlett (1946), Phillips (1959) and Durbin (1961). In the last ten years there has been a resurgence of interest in continuous-time processes partly as a result of the very successful application of stochastic differential equation models to problems in finance, exemplified by the derivation of the Black-Scholes option-pricing formula and its generalizations (Hull and White, 1987). Numerous examples of econometric applications of continuous-time models are contained in the book of Bergstrom (1990). Continuous-time models have also been utilized very successfully for the modelling of irregularly-spaced data (Jones, 1981, Jones, 1985, Jones and Ackerson (1990)). At the same time there has been an increasing realization that non-linear time series models provide much better representations of many empirically observed time series than linear models. The threshold ARMA models of Tong, 1983, Tong, 1990, have been particularly successful in representing a wide variety of data sets, and the ARCH and GARCH models of Engle (1982) and Bollerslev (1986) respectively have had great success in the modelling of financial data. Continuous-time versions of ARCH and GARCH models have been developed by Nelson (1990). In this paper we discuss continuous-time ARMA models, their basic properties, their relationship with discrete-time ARMA models, inference based on observations made at discrete times and non-linear processes which include continuous-time analogues of Tong's threshold ARMA models.},

	abstract = {The growing field of large-scale time domain astronomy requires methods for probabilistic data analysis that are computationally tractable, even with large datasets. Gaussian Processes are a popular class of models used for this purpose but, since the computational cost scales, in general, as the cube of the number of data points, their application has been limited to small datasets. In this paper, we present a novel method for Gaussian Process modeling in one-dimension where the computational requirements scale linearly with the size of the dataset. We demonstrate the method by applying it to simulated and real astronomical time series datasets. These demonstrations are examples of probabilistic inference of stellar rotation periods, asteroseismic oscillation spectra, and transiting planet parameters. The method exploits structure in the problem when the covariance function is expressed as a mixture of complex exponentials, without requiring evenly spaced observations or uniform noise. This form of covariance arises naturally when the process is a mixture of stochastically-driven damped harmonic oscillators -- providing a physical motivation for and interpretation of this choice -- but we also demonstrate that it can be a useful effective model in some other cases. We present a mathematical description of the method and compare it to existing scalable Gaussian Process methods. The method is fast and interpretable, with a range of potential applications within astronomical data analysis and beyond. We provide well-tested and documented open-source implementations of this method in C++, Python, and Julia.},

We do not find statistically significant interband continuum lags in NGC 5548, NGC 3783, or Fairall 9. Wavelength-dependent continuum lags may be marginally detected in the case of NGC 4151. However, on the basis of theoretical considerations, wavelength-dependent continuum lags in sources other than NGC 7469 are not expected to have been detectable in previous experiments.

We successfully recover reverberation time delays between the g+i band emission and the broad Hβ emission line for a total of 44 quasars, and for the broad Hα emission line in 18 quasars. Time delays are computed using the JAVELIN and CREAM software and the traditional interpolated cross-correlation function (ICCF): using well-defined criteria, we report measurements of 32 Hβ and 13 Hα lags with JAVELIN, 42 Hβ and 17 Hα lags with CREAM, and 16 Hβ and eight Hα lags with the ICCF. Lag values are generally consistent among the three methods, though we typically measure smaller uncertainties with JAVELIN and CREAM than with the ICCF, given the more physically motivated light curve interpolation and more robust statistical modeling of the former two methods. The median redshift of our Hβ-detected sample of quasars is 0.53, significantly higher than that of the previous reverberation mapping sample. We find that in most objects, the time delay of the Hα emission is consistent with or slightly longer than that of Hβ. We measure black hole masses using our measured time delays and line widths for these quasars. These black hole mass measurements are mostly consistent with expectations based on the local – relationship, and are also consistent with single-epoch black hole mass measurements. This work increases the current sample size of reverberation-mapped active galaxies by about two-thirds and represents the first large sample of reverberation mapping observations beyond the local universe (z {\textless} 0.3).},

We find good agreement with the DRW model on timescales that are well sampled by the data (from a month to a few years), possibly with some intrinsic scatter in the additional parameters, but this conclusion depends on the statistical test employed and is sensitive to whether the estimates of the photometric errors are correct to within {\textasciitilde}10\%. On very short timescales (below a few months), we see some evidence of the existence of a cutoff below which the correlation is stronger than the DRW model, echoing the recent finding of Mushotzky et al. using quasar light curves from Kepler.

Assuming that all emission-line light curves are scaled, smoothed, and displaced versions of the continuum, this alternative approach fits the light curves directly using a damped random walk model and aligns them to recover the time lag and its statistical confidence limits. We introduce the mathematical formalism of this approach and demonstrate its ability to cope with some of the problems for traditional methods, such as irregular sampling, correlated errors, and seasonal gaps. We redetermine the lags for 87 emission lines in 31 quasars and reassess the BLR size-luminosity relationship using 60 Hβ lags. We confirm the general results from the traditional cross-correlation methods, with a few exceptions. Our method, however, also supports a broad range of extensions. In particular, it can simultaneously fit multiple lines and continuum light curves which improves the lag estimate for the lines and provides estimates of the error correlations between them. Determining these correlations is of particular importance for interpreting emission-line velocity-delay maps. We can also include parameters for luminosity-dependent lags or line responses. We use this to detect the scaling of the BLR size with continuum luminosity in NGC 5548.},

In this document, we describe the algorithm and the details of our implementation.

	abstract = {The growing field of large-scale time domain astronomy requires methods for probabilistic data analysis that are computationally tractable, even with large data sets. Gaussian processes (GPs) are a popular class of models used for this purpose, but since the computational cost scales, in general, as the cube of the number of data points, their application has been limited to small data sets. In this paper, we present a novel method for GPs modeling in one dimension where the computational requirements scale linearly with the size of the data set. We demonstrate the method by applying it to simulated and real astronomical time series data sets. These demonstrations are examples of probabilistic inference of stellar rotation periods, asteroseismic oscillation spectra, and transiting planet parameters. The method exploits structure in the problem when the covariance function is expressed as a mixture of complex exponentials, without requiring evenly spaced observations or uniform noise. This form of covariance arises naturally when the process is a mixture of stochastically driven damped harmonic oscillators—providing a physical motivation for and interpretation of this choice—but we also demonstrate that it can be a useful effective model in some other cases. We present a mathematical description of the method and compare it to existing scalable GP methods. The method is fast and interpretable, with a range of potential applications within astronomical data analysis and beyond. We provide well-tested and documented open-source implementations of this method in C++, Python, and Julia.},

Our data span four years of spectroscopic and photometric monitoring for a total baseline of 1300 days, allowing us to measure lags up to ∼750 days in the observed frame (this corresponds to a rest-frame lag of ∼300 days in a quasar at z = 1.5 and ∼190 days at z = 3). We report significant time delays between the continuum and the C IV λ1549 emission line in 48 quasars, with an estimated false-positive detection rate of 10\%. Our analysis of marginal lag measurements indicates that there are on the order of ∼100 additional lags that should be recoverable by adding more years of data from the program. We use our measurements to calculate black hole masses and fit an updated C IV radius-luminosity relationship. Our results significantly increase the sample of quasars with C IV RM results, with the quasars spanning two orders of magnitude in luminosity toward the high-luminosity end of the C IV radius-luminosity relation. In addition, these quasars are located at some of the highest redshifts (z ≈ 1.4-2.8) of quasars with black hole masses measured with RM. This work constitutes the first large sample of C IV RM measurements in more than a dozen quasars, demonstrating the utility of multiobject RM campaigns.},

We successfully recover reverberation time delays between the g+i band emission and the broad Hβ emission line for a total of 44 quasars, and for the broad Hα emission line in 18 quasars. Time delays are computed using the JAVELIN and CREAM software and the traditional interpolated cross-correlation function (ICCF): using well-defined criteria, we report measurements of 32 Hβ and 13 Hα lags with JAVELIN, 42 Hβ and 17 Hα lags with CREAM, and 16 Hβ and eight Hα lags with the ICCF. Lag values are generally consistent among the three methods, though we typically measure smaller uncertainties with JAVELIN and CREAM than with the ICCF, given the more physically motivated light curve interpolation and more robust statistical modeling of the former two methods. The median redshift of our Hβ-detected sample of quasars is 0.53, significantly higher than that of the previous reverberation mapping sample. We find that in most objects, the time delay of the Hα emission is consistent with or slightly longer than that of Hβ. We measure black hole masses using our measured time delays and line widths for these quasars. These black hole mass measurements are mostly consistent with expectations based on the local \{M\}\{BH\}-\{σ \}* relationship, and are also consistent with single-epoch black hole mass measurements. This work increases the current sample size of reverberation-mapped active galaxies by about two-thirds and represents the first large sample of reverberation mapping observations beyond the local universe (z {\textless} 0.3).},

The z -transformed discrete correlation function (ZDCF) is a new method for estimating the CCF of sparse, unevenly sampled light curves. Unlike the commonly used interpolation method, it does not assume that the light curves are smooth and it does provide errors on its estimates. The ZDCF corrects several biases of the discrete correlation function method of Edelson \& Krolik (1988) by using equal population binning and Fisher's z -transform. These lead to a more robust and powerful method of estimating the CCF of sparse light curves of as few as 12 points. Two examples of light curve analysis with the ZDCF are presented. 1) The ZDCF estimate of the auto-correlation function is used to uncover a correlation between AGN magnitude and variability time scale in a small simulated sample of very sparse and irregularly sampled light curves. 2) A maximum likelihood function for the ZDCF peak location is used to estimate the time-lag between two light curves. Fortran 77 and 95 code implementations of the ZDCF and the maximum likelihood peak location (PLIKE) algorithms are freely available (see http://www.weizmann.ac.il/weizsites/tal/research/software/).},

By identifying the effective number of parameters for the ROA model, in terms of the shape and width of its window function and the times and accuracies of the data, we enable a Bayesian analysis, optimizing the ROA width, along with other model parameters, by minimizing the Bayesian information criterion (BIC) and sampling joint posterior parameter distributions using MCMC methods. For analysis of quasar light curves, our implementation of ROA modelling can measure time delays among light curves at different wavelengths or from different images of a lensed quasar and, in future work, be used to inter-calibrate light-curve data from different telescopes and estimate the shape and thus the power-density spectrum of the light curve. Our noise model implements a robust treatment of outliers and error-bar adjustments to account for additional variance or poorly quantified uncertainties. Tests with simulated data validate the parameter uncertainty estimates. We compare ROA delay measurements with results from cross-correlation and from JAVELIN, which models light curves with a prior on the power-density spectrum. We analyse published COSMOGRAIL light curves of multilensed quasar light curves and present the resulting measurements of the inter-image time delays and detection of microlensing effects.},
